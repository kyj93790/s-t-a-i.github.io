**Expectations**

We expect postdocs to be independent researchers who can manage multiple research threads in the lab through supervision, while pursuing their own first-author agenda. A research vision broader than a single project is expected.

**Application process**

1. Send an email to [Seong Joon Oh](mailto:coallaoh@gmail.com) with your CV and research statement attached
2. Coffee chat with Seong Joon to figure out initial fit
3. On-site interview day (we support travel for on-site visits; remote interview possible if travel is not feasible)
   - *Job talk*: Present your prior work to the entire lab (30 minutes + discussion)
   - *1-on-1 interviews*: Meet individually with 4+ lab members (on-site: scheduled throughout the day; remote: candidate reaches out to members and arranges meetings individually)
   - *Future research discussion*: Chat with Seong Joon about research directions at the intersection of your expertise and our vision
   - *Lab lunch/dinner*: Informal time to get to know the team
4. Offer
